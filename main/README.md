# Ghostman

This project is a halloween twist on the classic Hangman game where your goal is to not hang a man, but to trap as many ghosts as you can.

**Rules:**
- There are 6 ghosts trapped in a cage near your pumpkin patch.

- When YOU free a ghost, it thanks you by watering your pumpkin patch growing a pumpkin.

- If a ghost breaks out of the cage by itself, then it will eat a pumpkin from your patch.

You can free a ghost by:
- taking turns to guess an unknown word.
- In every turn you can choose to guess a letter or the entire word.
- If you guess a letter correctly, all occurrences of the letter will be revealed. and you will free one of the ghosts
- When you guess the entire word correctly, all the remaining ghosts are freed and all of them will water your patch. These ghosts are extra-grateful and will grow twice the number of pumpkins than the one you released by guessing a letter.

A ghost breaks out of the cage by itself when:
- you guess a letter incorrectly
- all the ghosts break out of their cages when guess the entire word incorrectly.
- Each of these ghosts eat one pumpkin from your patch.


Also, your pumpkin patch is not so big. So you can only grow a maximum of 100 pumpkins :(
