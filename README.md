## Introduction
You own a pumpkin patch, and there are 10 ghosts, each locked in a cage beside your patch.

You take turns guessing an unknown word.<br>
1. If you guess the whole word or a letter correctly, you free <em>"happy ghosts"</em> which water your patch and grow pumpkins. <br><br>

2. If you guess a letter or the word incorrectly, <em>"angry ghosts"</em> break out of their cages, and eat the pumpkins from your patch.<br><br>

3. You can choose to use a hint or give up, in which case you will free the <em>"neutral ghosts"</em> which will neither grow pumpkins nor eat the ones in your patch.<br><br>

4. NOTE: Your patch is small, so you can only grow a maximum of 100 pumpkins at a time. So once you have filled the patch, you can harvest it, and restart the game.<br><br>

5. You can see the total number of ghosts you have made happy, angry and neutral along with the total number of pumpkins you have grown in all of the harvests combined.
